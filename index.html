						<h1 class="colortext">Hey, y'all!</h2>
						<br/>
						<p>
							Let me introduce myself. I'm Jullie Utsch, a 24-year-old Communication student based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil; <mark>passionate</mark> about art, web, coding and telling great stories with all types of media. I've got a <mark>hybrid</mark> professional profile, with skills and experiences with art, communication, politics, audiovisuals and coding.
						</p>
						<p>
							Last year I've came back coding more actively thanks to Outreachy program, and had the chance to know Mozilla from the inside at the Winter '15/16 Oureachy batch. After that, I've been working as a full time developer. Right now I work as a junior consultant for Thoughtworks, and besides writing code in Java, I have this great daily opportunity to work with communities and social justice. I love what I do and where I am, but Mozilla's opening and this amazing opportunity of a global experience simply made me thrilled - and I decided to give it a shot. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm a human rights activist. I believe and advocate on equality, justice and running a better world. I've been involved with projects to promote women in tech, and it is a subject that is really important to me. I'm a proud coder latina girl and I know it matters. 
						</p>
						<p>	
							I thought you would like to know a little bit more about my professional path. Take a look!

				              	<hr/>
				              	During the second half of 2011 I started another internship at the communication assessory of the Health Campus at UFMG. I was responsible for editing and maintaining web pages. I stayed there for two years and quit in 2012 to do research on gender studies.

				              <p>At the time, the TRAMAS group was researching the violence against women narrated by journalism. I learned a lot about the theoretical aspects of gender studies, but also it was my first time dealing by myself with some data, trying to extract some conclusions on a lot of statistics we had. It was a great experience that resulted on some papers published, and it really challenged me to study more about extracting value from data. </p>

			              	Back to Belo Horizonte, I started a new internship as a content planner for Rock Content, a huge startup which focus on content marketing and blogs. I had the chance to create and plan content for companies from all different markets and sizes. Got involved with tech communities and decided to get more involved with tech again.

			              	Finally, at the end of the year, I've got selected to an Outreachy grant and went to Mozilla all hands, my first time at the US.

				              	I spent 3 months as an intern at Mozilla and worked with User Advocacy team on how to improve display experience on data. After that, as soon as Outreachy program finished, by March, I came back working as a coder. Worked as an intern for 4 months at an agency before reaching a developer position at Thoughtworks, where I've been for the last 8 months.
				              	<hr/>
				              	I had the privilege to spend 1.5 month in India with 83 other people from more than 10 different countries, sharing experiences, tech and social knowledge. This was Thoughtworks University program, a lifetime experience that I feel grateful for.
				              	<hr/>
				              	Right now I work as a Java consultant-developer for an american Thoughtworks' client. That means a lot of client conversation, approaching, team-thinking, influencing and -tada!- coding work with an amazing global team. I also have a chance to advocate social justice among local groups and organizations.
